screenshot should be as compact as possible, but still look real enough and probably contain:
some win
some fail
debug setup of http probe
debug background swift container operation (creation/deletion)
assertions on processes
assert on listening
assert on http
assert on swift checksum or container/object existence
assert on output pattern / error
-p feature (but only once!), showing a list of all errors
ending summary

to take an updated screnshot:
cp docs/testcase_for_screenshot.sh tests/swift_container_exists_before_launch.sh
config=/home/dieter/workspaces/eclipse/transcoder/vega/config.sh
./sbb.sh -c $config -d -p swift_container_exists_before_launch
rm tests/swift_container_exists_before_launch.sh

copy paste this text for -p:
on every failure, i can interact with the environment/processes as they are, to see what's going on and fix it
